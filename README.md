# Words-reader

The script takes words or phrases list (each word is on one line) from stdin and produce ..mp3 files for each line from file.
Script takes also language from -l parameter (I added only my languages: English, Russian, Spanish, but any other supported by  gtts can easily be added)

To my mind, efficient way to learn foreign language is to listen to your vocabulary. But who can pronounce all that new words correctly? That's why i decided to ask Google for help...
